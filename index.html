        <h1>Random practice</h1>
        <p>Hello, this is a random test with HTML I am doing to practice a few different HTML elements i have learned so far
            with the odin project.
        </p>
        <h2>Unordered list practice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A</li>
            <li>D</li>
            <li>Z</li>
            <li>O</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ordered list pracitce</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A</li>
            <li>B</li>
            <li>C</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Bold and Italization practice</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we want to make words <strong>bold</strong> for our web page.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we might want to make our words <em>italicized</em> as well.</p>
        <p>It's best practice to use <em><strong>em and strong</strong></em> instead of <strong>i and b</strong> because it helps
        those that use screen-readers be able to pickup what needs to be picked up.</p>
        <!-- that is all. -->
